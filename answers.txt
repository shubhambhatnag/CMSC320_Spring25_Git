Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git helps you track your changes and work with other people. I can roll back to a previous change, or track different issues across different branches. When working with others, I can merge and integrate my changes with their work.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science could be applied to the field of computational biology. For example, if I had a dataset full of molecules with a certain property (ex. binding to a certain receptor), I can use data sciecne to analyze and visualize the data, to determine insights and interesting patterns.Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging preserves branch history by creating a merge commit, while rebasing rewrites history by applying commits sequentially onto a new base, resulting in a linear history. Rebasing is cleaner to look at, but can be risky.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I'm looking forward to learning more advanced topics in data science, and leveraging it in personal projects/internships!
