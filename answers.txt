Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science could be applied to the field of computational biology. For example, if I had a dataset full of molecules with a certain property (ex. binding to a certain receptor), I can use data sciecne to analyze and visualize the data, to determine insights and interesting patterns.
